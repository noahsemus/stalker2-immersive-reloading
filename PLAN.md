# ImmersiveReloading — plan

Sprint and reload at the same time, with an optional reload-speed setting.

## How the game does it today (evidence: kit file:line, probe runs, tester reports)
_(research first: harness/docs/zonekit.md)_

## Approach, cheapest and least conflicting first
Prefer, in order: a cfg patch file → a NewContent runtime host (ModWorldSubsystem + actor) → an asset override
(only with the tester's explicit decision; list who else overrides it).
